## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

- How to use z-index and positioning.
- How to plan better layout.

### Continued development

- Being more semantic in using HTML elements.
- I will do better next time when it comes to assignning CSS classes. Should be clean and reusable.
